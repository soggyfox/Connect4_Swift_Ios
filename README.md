# Connect 4 Swift IOS Game
## Why swift 14 was used
Although I had version 13 working on my smaller laptop, when the swift 14 version came out I wanted to code on my more powerful laptop so I used the 14 version to code this project. 
## How to Run
Beware it may take a few seconds to not be a white screen and load up connect4. 
NOTE - functionality not working, expalined in pdf document. 
Open the app, it requires swift 14 to run. Compile and Press run. You must now select "yes" on the popup and then tap the screen with your finger over the column on which you wish to drop a disk. Then it will be the other player's turn to drop a disk. Press the reset button on the top right to reset the game. Go on the history tab via the bottom right to see previously played games.
